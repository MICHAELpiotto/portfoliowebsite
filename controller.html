      <h3>What I Did:</h3>
      <p>I designed and built a remote controller for launching model rockets, including the full electronic system and a custom enclosure to house the circuit. The project involved integrating RF communication, control logic, and power electronics into a purpose-built device intended for safe remote launch of model rockets.</p>

      <h3>How I Did It:</h3>
      <p>I built the controller around 433 MHz RF transmitter and receiver modules. The transmitter is battery-powered and controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico. An onboard speaker provides audible feedback to indicate when detonation data is being transmitted, using distinct beep patterns.

On the receiver side, a MOSFET driven by a 20 V battery is used to control ignition of the ignitors. Data transmitted between the RF modules consists of Manchester-encoded square-wave signals at 433 MHz.

I wrote MicroPython to control both Raspberry Pi Picos and implemented PIO assembly code to generate and decode the RF data stream. A specific pulse length, period, and transmission duration are required for the receiver to recognize a valid command and saturate the MOSFET, initiating ignition.

To reduce the risk of misfires, I incorporated diodes and pull-down resistors into the circuit. Both the transmitter and receiver electronics were housed in custom 3D-printed enclosures designed specifically for this system.
</p>

      <h3>Results:</h3>
      <p>The controller successfully transmitted launch commands to the receiver, reliably igniting the rocket motors without misfires. Audible feedback from the transmitter confirmed signal transmission, and the 3D-printed</p>

        <h4 class="feature-box-title">Speaker response</h4>
        <p>I previously made a timer based remote launcher where I used LED to indicate when the launch sequence had begun, however, they proved ineffective in bright sunlight. To address this, I integrated a speaker into the transmitter controller to provide audible feedback. This approach ensures the operator receives clear launch-status confirmation regardless of outside conditions. This system will make it safer ensuring the operator knows it is safe to approach the receiver module in the event of an issue.</p>

        <h4 class="feature-box-title">Repurposed Aluminum Arm</h4>
        <p>I repurposed an aluminum arm from a broken derailleur, cutting it to length and reusing the original spring and clip. I adjusted the spring hole angles to achieve the correct chain tension, and carefully designed tolerances so the arm could move freely once the C-clip was installed. The arm’s position was optimized in Creo using a kinematic mechanism simulation to approximate the ideal placement and tension for the desired chain length.</p>
