      <h3>What I Did:</h3>
      <p>I designed and built a dual-engine (clustered) motor mount for a custom model rocket. The rocket was developed as a modular system, consisting of a fin assembly, and motor housing components to be fabricated independently and bonded during final assembly.</p>

      <h3>How I Did It:</h3>
      <p>I designed the rocket in CAD for the parts to be 3d printed out of PETG. For the 3D-printed components, I calculated effective material density based on the selected infill percentage and material properties. This was combined with the measured density of the cardboard body tube and the mass properties of the rocket motors. Using these inputs, I used Creo’s built-in mass properties and simulation tools to determine the rocket’s center of mass (CM). To evaluate aerodynamic stability, I iteratively modified the fin (wing) geometry and placement. Using Barrowman’s equations, I calculated the center of pressure (CP) for multiple fin profiles, sizes, and axial positions relative to the rocket base. With the computed CM and CP values, I calculated the stability margin (in calibers) and adjusted the fin design to achieve a stable configuration.</p>

      <h3>Results:</h3>
      <p>Both rocket motors ignited simultaneously and remained securely retained throughout thrust. During ascent, the rocket exhibited coning caused by a low center of mass, resulting in noticeable oscillation in flight. Despite the instability, there were no catastrophic failures. The parachute deployed successfully, and the rocket was recovered.</p>

    <!-- First Key Feature -->

      <div class="feature-text">
        <h4 class="feature-box-title">Rocket Motor Threads</h4>
        <p>Model rocket motors are typically retained using friction-fit housings, which can be sensitive to manufacturing tolerances. To improve reliability and repeatability, I designed threads to secure the motor in place.  The motors used in this rocket are constructed from hard cardboard, so the thread geometry was designed to gradually decrease in diameter over approximately two full turns. This allows the motor to be installed securely through controlled compression. Care was taken to ensure the cardboard casing was not cut into, preserving the structural integrity of the motor. This design allowed the motors to be quickly and securely installed and prevented motor ejection during ignition of the ejection charge.</p>

    <!-- Second Key Feature -->
    <div class="key-features-content">
      <div class="feature-text">
        <h4 class="feature-box-title">Fin Geometry </h4>
        <p>When designing the fins, I selected a clipped delta geometry. Fin size and axial placement relative to the body were determined using Barrowman’s equations and the resulting stability margin. To increase stability, I attempted to induce spin. Instead of canting the fins, I used an airfoil-shaped profile to generate low pressure and high pressure based on Bernoulli’s principle. During flight, the rocket exhibited some spin; however, fin canting would likely produce more controllable rotation at lower speeds.
